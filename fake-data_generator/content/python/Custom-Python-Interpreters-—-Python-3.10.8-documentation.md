Custom Python Interpreters¶
The modules described in this chapter allow writing interfaces similar to
Python’s interactive interpreter.  If you want a Python interpreter that
supports some special feature in addition to the Python language, you should
look at the code module.  (The codeop module is lower-level, used
to support compiling a possibly incomplete chunk of Python code.)
The full list of modules described in this chapter is:


code — Interpreter base classes
Interactive Interpreter Objects
Interactive Console Objects


codeop — Compile Python code
