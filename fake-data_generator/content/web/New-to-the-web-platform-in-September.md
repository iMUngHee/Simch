 Home  All articles New to the web platform in SeptemberDiscover some of the interesting features that landed in stable and beta web browsers during September 2022.Sep 30, 2022   Rachel Andrew TwitterGitHubGlitchHomepageOn this page Stable browser releasesContainer queriesGrid layoutEncoding APINew Intl APIsThe showPicker() methodBeta browser releasesStable browser releases #In September, Firefox 105, Chrome 106, and Safari 16 became stable. This means that the September post is full of exciting things for the web platform.Container queries #Safari 16 adds support for container queries, a feature which is now available in two engines. Safari also adds support for the new container query units.Browser support: chrome 105, Supported   105   firefox, Not supported   ×   edge 105, Supported   105   safari 16, Supported   16    Source  Grid layout #Safari has landed support for the subgrid value of grid-template-columns and grid-template-rows. Using this value on a grid that is also a grid item means that instead of defining new tracks, the grid uses those that it spans of the parent.In Safari or Firefox the headers and footers in these cards will align, as their tracks are a subgrid of the parent.Browser support: chrome, Not supported   ×   firefox 71, Supported   71   edge, Not supported   ×   safari 16, Supported   16    Source  Also in Safari for for grid layout is the ability to animate grid tracks.Browser support: chrome 106, Supported   106   firefox 66, Supported   66   edge 106, Supported   106   safari 16, Supported   16  Safari has also added support for offset-path, overscroll-behavior, text-align-last, and the resolution media query.Encoding API #Firefox 105 supports the TextDecoderStream and TextEncoderStream interfaces of the Encoding API.Browser support: chrome 71, Supported   71   firefox 105, Supported   105   edge 79, Supported   79   safari 14.1, Supported   14.1    Source  New Intl APIs #The Intl APIs help to display content in a localized format and Chrome 106 adds a slew of new number format functionality.Like other Intl APIs, this shifts the burden to the system—so you don’t need to ship or maintain complex localization code to every user. The API knows where the currency symbol goes, how to format dates and times, or compile a list.The showPicker() method #Safari 16 contains the showPicker() method, enabling a canonical way to show a browser picker for dates, time, color, and files is included. You can find out more about this in show a browser picker for date, time, color, and files.Beta browser releases #Beta browser versions give you a preview of things that will be in the next stable version of the browser. It's a great time to test new features, or removals, that could impact your site before the world gets that release. New betas this month are Chrome 107, Safari 16.1, and Firefox 106.Chrome 107 includes the ability to animate grid tracks, that also shipped in Safari this month. Once this lands in Chrome it will be supported in all three major engines.Also in Chrome are some additions to getDisplayMedia() that aim to prevent accidental oversharing when screen sharing.The displaySurface option can indicate that the web app prefers to offer a specific display surface type (tabs, windows, or screens).The surfaceSwitching option indicates whether Chrome should allow the user to dynamically switch between shared tabs.The selfBrowserSurface option can be used to prevent the user from sharing the current tab. This avoids the "hall of mirrors" effect.The systemAudio option ensures Chrome only offers relevant audio-capture to the user.Safari 16.1 includes an additional fix to accessibility of display: contents, a fix to dynamic viewport height (dvh) units, and support for scroll to text fragments.Photo by Alexandr Podvalny.New to the web platform Last updated: Sep 30, 2022  —  Improve article   Return to all articles   Share   subscribe
