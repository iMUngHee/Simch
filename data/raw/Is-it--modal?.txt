This handy pseudo-selector gives you a way to select elements that are "modal", and to avoid managing classes in JavaScript by providing a way to detect modal elements.Browser support: chrome 105, Supported   105   firefox 103, Supported   103   edge 105, Supported   105   safari 15.6, Supported   15.6    Source  Two types of elements are currently classed as :modal:Dialog elements using the showModal method.Elements that are in full-screen mode.How can you use it? This example sets the scale of all <dialog> elements that are :modal.dialog:modal { scale: 2;} Consider this demo where you can show a <dialog> in either "modal" or "non-modal" styles.When you show the "modal" version, it uses the ::backdrop provided by the top layer.Top layer elements have a styleable backdrop element.dialog::backdrop { background: hsl(0 0% 10% / 0.5);} But, for the non-modal version which doesn't have a ::backdrop, a fake one gets created with the ::before pseudo-element. It's lighter and doesn't blur the content behind it. You could combine with :not to detect a non-modal <dialog>.dialog[open]:not(:modal)::before {  content: "";  position: fixed;  height: 100vh;  width: 100vw;  top: 50%;  left: 50%;  background: hsl(0 0% 10% / 0.25);  transform: translate3d(-50%, -50%, -1px);} This will also work for elements that are in full-screen mode too. Consider this heading element made of spans.<header>  <h1>    <span style="--index: 0;">:</span>    <span style="--index: 1;">m</span>    <span style="--index: 2;">o</span>    <span style="--index: 3;">d</span>    <span style="--index: 4;">a</span>    <span style="--index: 5;">l</span> </h1></header> When the element is in full-screen mode, the spans will animate.h1 span { animation: jump calc(var(--speed, 0) * 1s) calc(var(--index, 0) * 0.1s) infinite ease;}header:modal span {  --speed: 0.75;}@keyframes jump {  50% {    transform: translateY(-50%);  }} Photo by Volodymyr Hryshchenko on UnsplashCSSUXNewly interoperable Last updated: Sep 2, 2022  â€”  Improve article   Return to all articles   Share   subscribe
