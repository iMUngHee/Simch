Greetings Spring community,


The Spring Web Services team has released 4.0.0-RC1. This is the last planned release candidate that supports Spring Boot 3.0. The final GA release is coming next month in anticipation of Spring Boot 3.0 going GA.


4.0.x is the generation of Spring Web Services that works with Jakarta EE 9, the version where the enterprise specs (JAX-WS, etc.) migrate from javax. to jakarta.. See Juergen Holler’s blog post for more details about that.


Being based upon Spring Framework 6.0, this is also the generation of Spring Web Services that is rebased on top of Java 17 (LTS). So check it out!


For more details, read the following release notes for each version:

Note


This is to ensure Spring WS is running against the latest versions of libraries that are tied to Jakarta EE 9 (and NOT Jakarta EE 10, for which some are already supporting!)
