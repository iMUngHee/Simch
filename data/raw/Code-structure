          alert('Hello');

          alert('Hello')
alert('World')

            An example of an error
            If you’re curious to see a concrete example of such an error, check this code out:

      
        
        
          
            
          
          
            
          
        
        
          alert("Hello");

[1, 2].forEach(alert);
        
      
      
      No need to think about the meaning of the brackets [] and forEach yet. We’ll study them later. For now, just remember the result of running the code: it shows Hello, then 1, then 2.
Now let’s remove the semicolon after the alert:

      
        
        
          
            
          
          
            
          
        
        
          alert("Hello")

[1, 2].forEach(alert);
        
      
      
      The difference compared to the code above is only one character: the semicolon at the end of the first line is gone.
If we run this code, only the first Hello shows (and there’s an error, you may need to open the console to see it). There are no numbers any more.
That’s because JavaScript does not assume a semicolon before square brackets [...]. So, the code in the last example is treated as a single statement.
Here’s how the engine sees it:

      
        
        
          
            
          
          
            
          
        
        
          alert("Hello")[1, 2].forEach(alert);
        
      
      
      Looks weird, right? Such merging in this case is just wrong. We need to put a semicolon after alert for the code to work correctly.
This can happen in other situations also.

      
        
        
          
            
          
          
            
          
        
        
          // This comment occupies a line of its own
alert('Hello');

alert('World'); // This comment follows the statement
        
      
      
      
      
        
        
          
            
          
          
            
          
        
        
          /* An example with two messages.
This is a multiline comment.
*/
alert('Hello');
alert('World');
        
      
      
      
      
        
        
          
            
          
          
            
          
        
        
          /* Commenting out the code
alert('Hello');
*/
alert('World');
        
      
      
      
            Use hotkeys!
            In most editors, a line of code can be commented out by pressing the Ctrl+/ hotkey for a single-line comment and something like Ctrl+Shift+/ – for multiline comments (select a piece of code and press the hotkey). For Mac, try Cmd instead of Ctrl and Option instead of Shift.

            Nested comments are not supported!
            There may not be /*...*/ inside another /*...*/.
Such code will die with an error:

      
        
        
          
            
          
          
            
          
        
        
          /*
  /* nested comment ?!? */
*/
alert( 'World' );
