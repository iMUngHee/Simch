            Please note:
            As a rule, only the simplest scripts are put into HTML. More complex ones reside in separate files.
The benefit of a separate file is that the browser will download it and store it in its cache.
Other pages that reference the same script will take it from the cache instead of downloading it, so the file is actually downloaded only once.
That reduces traffic and makes pages faster.

            If src is set, the script content is ignored.
            A single <script> tag can’t have both the src attribute and code inside.
This won’t work:

      
        
        
          <script src="file.js">
  alert(1); // the content is ignored, because src is set
</script>
        
      
      
      We must choose either an external <script src="…"> or a regular <script> with code.
The example above can be split into two scripts to work:

      
        
        
          <script src="file.js"></script>
<script>
  alert(1);
</script>
