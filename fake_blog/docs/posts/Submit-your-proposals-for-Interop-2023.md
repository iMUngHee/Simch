 Home  All articles Submit your proposals for Interop 2023We are thrilled at the progress of Interop 2022 that we’ve made together and are excited to announce that Interop 2023 is happening!Sep 21, 2022   Rachel Andrew TwitterGitHubGlitchHomepage   Robert Nyman TwitterGitHubHomepage   Philip Jägenstedt TwitterGitHubHomepageThe Chrome team has worked with other browser vendors and partners in the ecosystem to help improve browser compatibility since 2019, starting with the MDN Developer Needs Assessment survey and most recently on Interop 2022. For Interop 2022, all major browser vendors and other stakeholders worked together to improve top browser compatibility issues identified by web developers. We are thrilled at the progress that we’ve made together and are excited to announce Interop 2023 is happening!March 2022.September 2022.The Interop 2023 proposal process is now open for submissions. Suggestions can include features that behave differently across browsers, or features that are not yet implemented in all browsers. Keep in mind that proposals with high quality specifications and web platform tests are more likely to be included, as this project is about reaching interoperability rather than specifying new features. The proposal submission process ends October 15, 2022.Once the proposal period ends, the collected submissions will be discussed by browser vendors and other partners to determine the final list. It’s likely that there will be more proposals than can be achieved during 2023, so some high quality proposals may not be selected. We are looking forward to reviewing all the submissions, and we’ll post the final list here once Interop 2023 gets underway.CSS Last updated: Sep 21, 2022  —  Improve article   Return to all articles   Share   subscribe
